 <h2>How Collected Information is Used</h2>
<p><strong>How Collected Information is Used</strong></p>
<p>The non-personally identifiable data that VEGETARIAN EXPRESS collects is used
  for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content
  to individuals in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for
  each person.</p>
<p>The data is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help
  determine which marketing campaigns perform best and which content is most
  appropriate for different individuals.</p>
<p>If a user elects to provide VEGETARIAN EXPRESS with
  personally identifiable data, we may utilise such data for marketing purposes.
  In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other
  sources to assist with targeting sales to a user's preferences and behaviours,
  and for other sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing With Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in
  confidence by VEGETARIAN EXPRESS. There are instances, however, in which personally
  identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third
  parties, as described below.</p>
<p>The non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners
  of VEGETARIAN EXPRESS on an anonymous basis.</p>
<p>With respect to personally identifiable information, VEGETARIAN EXPRESS may,
  from time to time, provide information to certain third-party administrative
  vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as
  billing or for other services related to providing an VEGETARIAN EXPRESS product or service. Any third-party vendor so used will be required
  to enter into a confidentiality agreement with VEGETARIAN EXPRESS.</p>
<p>VEGETARIAN EXPRESS may also share personally identifiable
  information with third parties who enter into business relationships with us.
  These business partners may include financial service providers (including
  credit bureaux and insurance agents); non-financial companies (including retailers,
  online and offline advertisers, membership list vendors, direct marketers and
  publishers); companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, and others
  such as non-profit organisations. We may also disclose information to a third
  party who provides substantially similar services as the original service signed
  up for, we decide to stop providing such services ourselves. In such situations,
  we will provide our users with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing.
  Please be aware that VEGETARIAN EXPRESS is very careful
  about which companies it does business with.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that VEGETARIAN EXPRESS, or part(s) of VEGETARIAN EXPRESS, may one day be purchased by, or merged with,
  another company. In such a case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have
  access to your information.</p>

  necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and
  law enforcement officials.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>VEGETARIAN EXPRESS makes significant efforts to maintain
  the security of its network and the data we collect. We use various technologies,
  including, in certain instances, encryption, to ensure the high security standards.
  Any data that is stored on VEGETARIAN EXPRESS's servers is treated as confidential
  and is not generally available to the public. VEGETARIAN EXPRESS has an internal
  security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data,
  limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know
  such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. Please keep in mind,
  however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Therefore, although
  we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody
defeating our security measures does exist.</p>

  provided personally identifiable data access to their data to ensure that it
  is correct and to make any changes. Please contact us <a href="http://www.vegexp.co.uk/contact.cfm">contact
